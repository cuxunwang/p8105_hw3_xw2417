This file is the solution to P8105 Homework 3 from Xun Wang (xw2417).

Besides loading `library` in the beginning, I also include figure preferences in global options as this code chunk.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUEï¼Œ
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%")

theme_set(theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

```

## Problem 1

This problem uses the *Instacart* dataset. 

```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")


```


#### 1.1 

The code chunk below
